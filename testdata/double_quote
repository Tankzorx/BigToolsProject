This is OS X, but it might as well be Linux or Solaris.  Essentially I'm running bash here.  It's a program.  it doesn't run in any kind of crazy subsystem.  It doesn't require separate security.  It doesn't act as sume kind of emulator or compatibility layer,  It's just a program running in a window.  \n\nLook, I'm not going to tell anyone what they should or should not like.  So if you like cmd.exe and think that's okay, then rock out.  \n\nHowever, I refuse to accept this shit.  I don't use Windows (or MS software at all where I can avoid it) because of decisions like this.  MS decides to make command windows be DOS compatibility layers, which causes side-effects like not being able to theme the window or not being able to drop objects onto it.  \n\nThen, rather than fix those problems, they tell you that the faults are by design and you can just suck it up and like it.\n\nYeah, fuck that.","ups":13,"id":"c02s9sd","archived":true,"downs":0,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_647yd","name":"t1_c02s9sd","gilded":0,"author":"generalk"}
